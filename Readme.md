These files are not meant to be used in a real world scenario. These files are provided by the VATSIM Edmonton FIR as part of the VATNA and VATCAN for use on the Vatsim network.

## Edmonton Controllers

Edmonton Controllers will find the sectorfiles for Euroscope under Sector-Files -> Airac20XX.

It is important that all CZEG controllers are on the same version of Euroscope. The beta version 3.2.1.23 of Euroscope is the only version the Edmonton FIR supports. More recent versions are not fully vetted with our plugins and sector files.

## Sector File Installation Process

1. Navigate to the Sector-Files -> Airac20XX
2. Once in the folder click the Download button 
3. Navigate to the folder you wish to unzip in
4. If updating overwrite the nescessary files

If you are a new controller at Edmonton FIR installing the sector files is part of the orientation process
